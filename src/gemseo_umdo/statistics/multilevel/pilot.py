class Pilot(metaclass=ABCGoogleDocstringInheritanceMeta):
    r"""The base pilot for multilevel algorithms.

    A pilot is associated with a statistic, e.g. mean.
    The method
    [compute_next_level_and_statistic()][gemseo_umdo.statistics.multilevel.pilot.Pilot.compute_next_level_and_statistic]
    returns a multilevel estimation of the statistic based on the current samples
    and the next level $\ell^*$ of the telescopic sum to sample
    in order to improve this estimation.

    This level $\ell^*$ maximizes the criterion

    $$\frac{\mathcal{V}_\ell}
    {r_\ell n_\ell^2(\mathcal{C}_\ell+\mathcal{C}_{\ell-1})}$$

    where $\mathcal{C}_{\ell}$ is the unit evaluation cost
    of the model $f_\ell$ (with $\mathcal{C}_{-1}=0$),
    $n_\ell$ is the current number of evaluations of $f_\ell$
    and $r_\ell$ is the factor by which $n_\ell$ would be increased
    by choosing the level $\ell$.
    Regarding $\mathcal{V}_\ell$,
    it represents the variance of the $\ell$-th term of the telescopic sum
    characteristic of the MLMC techniques.
    For instance,
    $\mathcal{V}_\ell=\mathbb{E}[Y_\ell-Y_{\ell}]$ in the case of the expectation.
