"""Functions to estimate statistics from a [BaseUMDOFormulation][gemseo_umdo.formulatio
ns.base_umdo_formulation.BaseUMDOFormulation].

The base function is a
[BaseStatisticFunction][gemseo_umdo.formulations._functions.base_statistic_function.BaseStatisticFunction]
and derives from an
[MDOFunction][gemseo.core.mdofunctions.mdo_function.MDOFunction].
Most of the other _functions derive from
[BaseStatisticFunction][gemseo_umdo.formulations._functions.base_statistic_function.BaseStatisticFunction]
and are associated with an
[BaseUMDOFormulation][gemseo_umdo.formulations.base_umdo_formulation.BaseUMDOFormulation],
e.g.
[Sampling][gemseo_umdo.formulations.sampling.Sampling].
and
[TaylorPolynomial][gemseo_umdo.formulations.taylor_polynomial.TaylorPolynomial].
The other modules are helpers.
