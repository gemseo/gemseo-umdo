# Firstly,
# we instantiate the disciplines of the Sellar problem:
system = AnalyticDiscipline(
    {
        "obj": "x**2 + z2 + y1**2 + exp(-y2)",
        "c1": "3.16 - y1 ** 2",
        "c2": "y2 - 24.0",
    }
)
disc1 = AnalyticDiscipline({"y1": "(z1**2 + z2 + x - 0.2*y2)**0.5"})
disc2 = AnalyticDiscipline({"y2": "abs(y1) + z1 + z2"})

# %%
# as well as the design space:
design_space = DesignSpace()
design_space.add_variable("x", 1, l_b=0.0, u_b=10.0, value=1.0)
design_space.add_variable("z1", 1, l_b=-10, u_b=10.0, value=4.0)
design_space.add_variable("z2", 1, l_b=0.0, u_b=10.0, value=3.0)

# %%
# Then,
# we build an :class:`~gemseo.core.mdo_scenario.MDOScenario`
# to minimize ``"obj"``:
scenario = MDOScenario(
    [system, disc1, disc2],
    formulation="MDF",
    objective_name="obj",
    design_space=design_space,
)
# %%
# while satisfying inequality constraints related to ``"c_1"`` and ``"c_2"``:
scenario.add_constraint("c1", "ineq")
scenario.add_constraint("c2", "ineq")
# %%
# and execute it with a gradient-free optimizer:
scenario.execute({"algo": "NLOPT_COBYLA", "max_iter": 200})

# %%
# Lastly,
# we can plot the optimization history view:
scenario.post_process("OptHistoryView", save=True, show=False)
