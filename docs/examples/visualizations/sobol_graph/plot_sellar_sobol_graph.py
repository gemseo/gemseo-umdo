# First,
# we consider the
# [SellarDesignSpace][gemseo.problems.mdo.sellar.sellar_design_space.SellarDesignSpace]
# as the uncertain space,
# which means that the uncertain variables are the design variables
# uniformly distributed between their lower and upper bounds:

# Then,
# we define the disciplines:

# Thirdly,
# we compute the Sobol' indices for all the outputs of the MDO problem:

# Lastly,
