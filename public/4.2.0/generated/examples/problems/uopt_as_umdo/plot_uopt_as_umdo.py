# Make a monodisciplinary optimization under uncertainty problem multidisciplinary

## Introduction

[UOptAsUMDOScenario][gemseo_umdo.problems.uopt_as_umdo_scenario.UOptAsUMDOScenario]
is a class to make a monodisciplinary optimization problem under uncertainty
multidisciplinary[@AzizAlaoui2025].
The only requirement is that
the discipline has at least three scalar inputs defined as design variables,
and at least one output defined as an objective.
These design variables may be uncertain.
The discipline may also have other inputs,
defined as design or uncertain variables,
and outputs,
defined as objectives or constraints.
This scenario can be used to enrich a catalog of benchmark U-MDO problems,
based on the observation that
MDO benchmark problems are far less numerous than optimization problems,
especially in the case of MDO under uncertainty.

This example illustrates it
in the case of the minimization of the 3-dimensional Rosenbrock function

$$\mathbb{E}[f(z,U,V)] = \mathbb{E}[100(z_2-(Uz_1)^2)^2 + (1-Vz_1)^2 + 100(z_1-(Uz_0)^2)^2 + (1-Vz_0)^2]$$

over the hypercube $[-1,1]^3$.

# %%
# ## Discipline and spaces
# First,
# we create the discipline implementing the Rosenbrock function:
discipline = create_discipline(
    "AnalyticDiscipline",
    expressions={
        "f": "100*(z_2-(u*z_1)**2)**2+(1-v*z_1)**2+100*(z_1-(u*z_0)**2)**2+(1-v*z_0)**2"
    },
    name="Rosenbrock",
)
# %%
# as well as the design space:
design_space = create_design_space()
design_space.add_variable("z_0", lower_bound=-1, upper_bound=1)
design_space.add_variable("z_1", lower_bound=-1, upper_bound=1)
design_space.add_variable("z_2", lower_bound=-1, upper_bound=1)
# %%
# and the uncertain space:
uncertain_space = ParameterSpace()
uncertain_space.add_random_variable("u", "OTNormalDistribution", mu=1.0, sigma=0.01)
uncertain_space.add_random_variable("v", "OTNormalDistribution", mu=1.0, sigma=0.01)
# %%
# We choose $x^{(0)}=(-0.25, 0.75, -0.9)$
# as the starting point of the optimization:
initial_point = array([-0.25, 0.75, -0.9])
design_space.set_current_value(initial_point)

# %%
# ## Optimization problem under uncertainty
# Then,
# we define the optimization problem under uncertainty,
# with statistics estimated by sampling:
u_opt_scenario = UMDOScenario(
    [discipline],
    "f",
    design_space,
    uncertain_space,
    "Mean",
    Sampling_Settings(n_samples=50),
    formulation_name="DisciplinaryOpt",
)
# %%
# and solve it using the SLSQP algorithm:
u_opt_scenario.execute(algo_name="NLOPT_SLSQP", max_iter=100)
# %%
# ## MDO problem under uncertainty
# Now,
# we use the
# [UOptAsUMDOScenario][gemseo_umdo.problems.uopt_as_umdo_scenario.UOptAsUMDOScenario]
# to rewrite this optimization problem under uncertainty
# as an MDO problem under uncertainty with two strongly coupled disciplines.
#
# First,
# we reset the design space to the initial point:
design_space.set_current_value(initial_point)
# %%
# and create the
# [UOptAsUMDOScenario][gemseo_umdo.problems.uopt_as_umdo_scenario.UOptAsUMDOScenario],
# orchestrated by an MDF formulation:
umdo_scenario = UOptAsUMDOScenario(
    discipline,
    "f",
    design_space,
    uncertain_space,
    "Mean",
    Sampling_Settings(n_samples=50),
    formulation_name="MDF",
)
# %%
# Then,
# we can see that the design variables have been renamed:
design_space
# %%
# This renaming is based on the convention:
#
# - the first design variable is the global design variable and is named $x_0$,
# - the $(1+i)$-th design variable is the local design variable
#   specific to the $i$-th strongly coupled discipline
#   and is named $x_{1+i}$.
#
# We can also have a look to the coupling graph:
generate_coupling_graph(umdo_scenario.disciplines, file_path="")
# %%
# and see that there are two strongly coupled disciplines $D_1$ and $D_2$,
# connected by the coupling variables $y_1$ and $y_2$.
# These disciplines are weakly coupled to a downstream link discipline $L$,
# which is weakly coupled to the downstream original discipline.
# Let us note that the link discipline computes
# the values of the design variables in the original optimization problem
# from the values of the design and coupling variables in the MDO problem.
#
# We can also represent the MDO process using an XDSM:
umdo_scenario.xdsmize(save_html=False, pdf_build=False)
# %%
# Lastly,
# we solve this scenario using the SLSQP algorithm:
umdo_scenario.execute(algo_name="NLOPT_SLSQP", max_iter=100)
# %%
# We can see that
# the numerical solution corresponds to the one found in the monodisciplinary case.
