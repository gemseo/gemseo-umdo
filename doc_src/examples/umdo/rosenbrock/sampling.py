# Firstly,
# we define an :class:`.AnalyticDiscipline`
# implementing a random version of the Rosenbrock function
# :math:`f(x,y,U)=(U-x)^2+100(y-x^2)^2`:
discipline = AnalyticDiscipline({"z": "(u-x)**2+100*(y-x**2)**2"}, name="Rosenbrock")

# %%
# where :math:`x,y` belongs to the interval :math:`\[-2,2\]`:
design_space = DesignSpace()
design_space.add_variable("x", l_b=-2, u_b=2.0, value=-2.0)
design_space.add_variable("y", l_b=-2, u_b=2.0, value=-2.0)

# %%
# and :math:`U` is a Gaussian variable with unit mean
# and standard deviation equal to 0.05:
uncertain_space = ParameterSpace()
uncertain_space.add_random_variable("u", "OTNormalDistribution", mu=1.0, sigma=0.05)

# %%
# Then,
# we build a :class:`UMDOScenario` to minimize a sampling-based estimation
# of the expectation :math:`\mathbb{E}[Y]` where :math:`Y=f(x,y,U)`:
scenario = UMDOScenario(
    [discipline],

    uncertain_space,
    "Mean",
    statistic_estimation="Sampling",
    statistic_estimation_options={"n_samples": 10},
)

# %%
# and execute it with a gradient-based optimizer:
scenario.set_differentiation_method("finite_differences")
# %%
# .. note::
#    The statistics do not allow for the moment to use analytical derivatives.
#    Please use finite differences or complex step to approximate the gradients.
scenario.execute({"algo": "NLOPT_SLSQP", "max_iter": 100})

# %%
# Lastly,
# we can plot the optimization history view:
scenario.post_process("OptHistoryView", save=True, show=True)
