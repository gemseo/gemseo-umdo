r"""# A quadratic mono-disciplinary problem

In this example, we consider the quadratic mono-disciplinary optimization problem

$$\min_{x\in[-1,1]} \mathbb{E}[(x+U)^2]$$

where $U\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is a standard Gaussian variable and $\mathbb{E}$ is the
expectation operator.

The objective can be rewritten as $x^2+1$ and then the solution is obvious, namely

$$(x^*,\mathbb{E}[(x^*+U)^2])=(0,1).$$

In the following, we will call $f$ the function computing $(x+U)^2$ given $x$ and $U$.

# %%
# Firstly,
# we define an [AnalyticDiscipline][gemseo.disciplines.analytic.AnalyticDiscipline]
# implementing the function $f$:
discipline = AnalyticDiscipline({"y": "(x+u)**2"}, name="f")

# %%
# as well as the design space:
design_space = DesignSpace()
design_space.add_variable("x", lower_bound=-1, upper_bound=1.0, value=0.5)

# %%
# and the uncertain space:
uncertain_space = ParameterSpace()
uncertain_space.add_random_variable("u", "OTNormalDistribution")

# %%
# Then,
# we define a [UMDOScenario][gemseo_umdo.scenarios.umdo_scenario.UMDOScenario]
# to minimize the statistic $\mathbb{E}[(x+U)^2]$
# estimated using a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE)
# trained from 20 samples at each iteration of the optimization loop:
scenario = UMDOScenario(
    [discipline],
    "y",
    design_space,
    uncertain_space,
    "Mean",
    formulation_name="DisciplinaryOpt",
    statistic_estimation_settings=PCE_Settings(n_samples=20),
)
# %%
# !!! note
#     The mean, standard deviation and variance
#     of the PCE built over the uncertain space
#     are differentiable with respect to the design variables
#     if both the disciplines and the MDO formulation are differentiable,
#     which is the case in this example.
#     This implies that a gradient-based optimization algorithm can be used
#     without approximating the derivatives of the objective.
#
# We execute this scenario using the gradient-based optimizer SLSQP:
scenario.execute(algo_name="NLOPT_SLSQP", max_iter=100)

# %%
# and plot the optimization history:
scenario.post_process(post_name="OptHistoryView", save=False, show=True)

# %%
# Notice that the numerical solution
(scenario.optimization_result.x_opt[0], scenario.optimization_result.f_opt)

# %%
# is close to the theoretical solution $(x^*,\mathbb{E}[(x^*+U)^2])=(0,1)$.
