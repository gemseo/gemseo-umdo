"""Functions to estimate statistics from an :class:`.UMDOFormulation`.

The base function is :class:`.StatisticFunction` and derives from :class:`.MDOFunction`.
Most of the other functions derive from :class:`.StatisticFunction`
and are associated with an :class:`.UMDOFormulation`,
e.g. :class:`.Sampling` and :class:`.TaylorPolynomial`.
The other modules are helpers.
