# First,
# we consider the :class:`.SellarDesignSpace` as the uncertain space,
# which means that the uncertain variables are the design variables
# uniformly distributed between their lower and upper bounds:
design_space = SellarDesignSpace()

# %%
# Then,
# we define the disciplines:
disciplines = [Sellar1(), Sellar2(), SellarSystem()]

# %%
# Thirdly,
# we compute the Sobol' indices for all the outputs of the MDO problem:
sobol_analysis = SobolAnalysis(disciplines, design_space, 100)
sobol_analysis.compute_indices()

# %%
# Lastly,
# we draw the Sobol' graph:
sobol_graph = SobolGraph.from_analysis(sobol_analysis, output_name="obj")
