    abstract = { For many engineering problems, reliability and robustness are far more important than the nominal performance when it comes to the choice of a design over another. Availability of state-of-the-art simulation codes and trusted modeling approaches help in reducing the epistemic uncertainties, but what is needed for decision-making is ultimately the knowledge of the aleatory uncertainty for the system of interest, and methods capable of minimizing such uncertainty while limiting the impact on the expected performance. A reliable measure of performance is only achieved if all uncertainties affecting the system’s geometry, physical properties and operational conditions can be propagated through the model equations to the quantities of interest. Optimization in a deterministic sense, providing the best possible performance for nominal values of the design variables, is then replaced by Robust Optimization, which aims at maximizing the expected performance while minimizing the probability of its degradation. Today, multi-physics problems and demanding high-fidelity simulations are common denominators in Aeronautics as well as in many other industrial fields. It is then necessary to employ techniques that are able to perform uncertainty quantification and propagation at reasonable costs, without requiring the development of dedicated solvers: Non-Intrusive Polynomial Chaos is a prime candidate, but not all of its variants are equally accurate and cost-effective. Efficiency and flexibility of Least Squares surrogates and gradient-enhanced Polynomial Chaos expansions for Uncertainty Quantification and Robust Optimization are discussed in this paper employing an in-house framework. Advantages of the proposed methods over Collocation approaches are demonstrated by comparing the results for a selection of algebraic test cases and for the shape optimization of the NACA 0012 airfoil under transonic conditions. }

abstract = {The reliability analysis procedure based on design of experiment (DOE) is combined with the response surface method (RSM) for numerical efficiency. Instead of using the inefficient full factorial DOE, a response surface is constructed initially based on the data on the axial experimental points and updated successively by adding one more experimental point selected using an influence index, until the probability is converged. It is calculated using the Pearson system and the four statistical moments obtained from the experimental data complemented by the response surface. During the update of a response surface, cross product terms can be added into the formulation. The number of updating steps is finite, since the points to be added are selected among the set of points of full factorial design. The performance of the proposed method is tested with several examples containing various types of distributions. It is shown that the probability converges early in the process and thus the amount of calculation is only a small fraction of that of a full factorial design. This is comparable or even better than any other methods including FORM for a moderate number of random variables tested.}

abstract = {Polynomial chaos (PC) expansions are used in stochastic finite element analysis to represent the random model response by a set of coefficients in a suitable (so-called polynomial chaos) basis. The number of terms to be computed grows dramatically with the size of the input random vector, which makes the computational cost of classical solution schemes (may it be intrusive (i.e. of Galerkin type) or non intrusive) unaffordable when the deterministic finite element model is expensive to evaluate. To address such problems, the paper describes a non intrusive method that builds a sparse PC expansion. First, an original strategy for truncating the PC expansions, based on hyperbolic index sets, is proposed. Then an adaptive algorithm based on least angle regression (LAR) is devised for automatically detecting the significant coefficients of the PC expansion. Beside the sparsity of the basis, the experimental design used at each step of the algorithm is systematically complemented in order to avoid the overfitting phenomenon. The accuracy of the PC metamodel is checked using an estimate inspired by statistical learning theory, namely the corrected leave-one-out error. As a consequence, a rather small number of PC terms are eventually retained (sparse representation), which may be obtained at a reduced computational cost compared to the classical “full” PC approximation. The convergence of the algorithm is shown on an analytical function. Then the method is illustrated on three stochastic finite element problems. The first model features 10 input random variables, whereas the two others involve an input random field, which is discretized into 38 and 30−500 random variables, respectively.}
