"""# Take advantage of vectorized disciplines

GEMSEO v6.2 opened the door to batch sampling
by making the MDO formulations support vectorized disciplines
and adding the ``vectorize`` option to the DOE algorithms.
In other words,
GEMSEO can evaluate a multidisciplinary system at several points at the same time,
without the need for multiple processes (see the DOE option ``n_processes`` for more information).
This can be particularly useful when evaluating such a system
in parallel is more expensive than evaluating it serially because
the disciplines are so inexpensive.
In this case, the batch sampling can be sequential.

To illustrate this new feature,
GEMSEO v6.2 vectorizes the disciplines of the Sellar problem
([Sellar1][gemseo.problems.mdo.sellar.sellar_1.Sellar1],
[Sellar2][gemseo.problems.mdo.sellar.sellar_2.Sellar2] and
[SellarSystem][gemseo.problems.mdo.sellar.sellar_system.SellarSystem]).
This example uses them to demonstrate the interest of vectorization
when solving an MDO problem under uncertainty
whose statistics are estimated by Monte Carlo sampling.
