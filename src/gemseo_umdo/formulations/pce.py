r"""FCE-based U-MDO formulation.

[PCE][gemseo_umdo.formulations.pce.PCE] is a
[BaseUMDOFormulation][gemseo_umdo.formulations.base_umdo_formulation.BaseUMDOFormulation]
estimating the statistics of $f(x,U)$ at a point $x$
from the coefficients of a functional chaos expansion (FCE) model

$$\hat{f}_x(U)=\alpha_0 + \sum_{1\geq i\leq P}\alpha_i\Phi_i(U)$$

built over the uncertain space.

E.g.

$$\mathbb{E}[f(x,U)] \approx \alpha_0$$

and

$$\mathbb{V}[f(x,U)] \approx \sum_{1\geq i\leq P}\alpha_i^2.$$

The best-known FCE is the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE),
hence the name of the U-MDO formulation.
