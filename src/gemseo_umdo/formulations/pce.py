r"""PCE-based U-MDO formulation.

[PCE][gemseo_umdo.formulations.pce.PCE] is an
[BaseUMDOFormulation][gemseo_umdo.formulations.base_umdo_formulation.BaseUMDOFormulation]
estimating the statistics from the coefficients of a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE).

E.g.

$$\mathbb{E}[f(x,U)] \approx \alpha_0$$

or

$$\mathbb{V}[f(x,U)] \approx \sum_{1<i\leq P}\alpha_i^2$$

where $(\alpha_i)_{1\leq i \leq N}$ are the coefficients of the PCE

$$\hat{f}_x(U)=\alpha_0 + \sum_{1<i\leq P}\alpha_i\Phi_i(U)$$

built at $x$ over the uncertain space.
