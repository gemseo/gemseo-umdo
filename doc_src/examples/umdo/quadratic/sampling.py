# Firstly,

# implementing the random function :math:`f(x,U)=(x+U)^2`:
discipline = AnalyticDiscipline({"y": "(x+u)**2"}, name="quadratic_function")

# where :math:`x` belongs to the interval :math:`\[-1,1\]`:
design_space = DesignSpace()
design_space.add_variable("x", l_b=-1, u_b=1.0, value=0.5)

# %%
# and :math:`U` is a standard Gaussian variable:
uncertain_space = ParameterSpace()
uncertain_space.add_random_variable("u", "OTNormalDistribution")

# %%
# Then,
# we build a :class:`UMDOScenario` to minimize a sampling-based estimation
# of the expectation :math:`\mathbb{E}[Y]` where :math:`Y=f(x,U)`:
scenario = UMDOScenario(

# %%
# We execute it with a gradient-free optimizer:
scenario.execute({"algo": "NLOPT_COBYLA", "max_iter": 100})

# %%
# and plot the history:
scenario.post_process("OptHistoryView", save=True, show=True)

# %%
# Notice that the numerical solution is equal to :math:`(x^*,f^*)=(0,1)` as expected
# from the expression of the statistic: :math:`\mathbb{E}[Y]=\mathbb{E}[(x+U)^2]=x^2+1`.
