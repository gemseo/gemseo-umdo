"""Functions to estimate statistics from an
[UMDOFormulation][gemseo_umdo.formulations.formulation.UMDOFormulation].

The base function is a
[StatisticFunction][gemseo_umdo.formulations._functions.statistic_function.StatisticFunction]
and derives from an
[MDOFunction][gemseo.core.mdofunctions.mdo_function.MDOFunction].
Most of the other _functions derive from
[StatisticFunction][gemseo_umdo.formulations._functions.statistic_function.StatisticFunction]
and are associated with an
[UMDOFormulation][gemseo_umdo.formulations.formulation.UMDOFormulation],
e.g.
[Sampling][gemseo_umdo.formulations.sampling.Sampling].
and
[TaylorPolynomial][gemseo_umdo.formulations.taylor_polynomial.TaylorPolynomial].
The other modules are helpers.
